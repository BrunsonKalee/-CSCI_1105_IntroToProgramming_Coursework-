# BlackJack
## Synopsis
This game allows one player to learn how to play Blackjack against a dealer easily. 
## Motivation
I decided to code this game because I liked a card game example in a book and wanted to expand on the example and make it into something of my own.
## How to Play
To play, decide whether or not to hit or stay and get a total value of '21', between one player and the dealer, to win. If the dealer has a higher number than the player, the dealer wins. When the player has a higher number than the dealer, the player wins. If either of them go over '21' they are going to bust. At the end of the game click 'Y' or 'N' when deciding to play again or not.
